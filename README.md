# Cars365 MVC
This project is a sample backend MVC application using Express JS, Prisma.IO and Sqlite.
The application itself is a simple CRUD app.
## Frontend
To test this application I also made a simple angular app. The FE is available here: https://github.com/gregory-villmann/Cars365-FE/

Run 'npm run start' to start the server at 'http://localhost:3000'.
